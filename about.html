    <h3 class="text1">In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, and I love to be able to travel and explore. I enjoy seeing new things and having new expirences, as well as just being out doors and doing activities such as camping, hiking, and fishing. I do most of these activities with my girlfriend, who loves doing them as much as I do. </h3>
